#My portfolio website

I have used html, css and js to make this , the background animations that we see on the home page are also implemented through css and the rolling text was implemented with js. I have implemented responsiveness properly in the all three hobbies pages and somewhat in the index page. Although sufficient time was given to make this a very epik website, but my procrastination say no. Still tried my best to do in 3-4 days. Will be more diligent from now on

TO RUN IT:
 download the 'untitled folder' and it contains all the files necessary to run the website.
